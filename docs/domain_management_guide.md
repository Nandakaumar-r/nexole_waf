## DNS Configuration

After adding a domain, you need to configure your DNS records to route traffic through the WAF:

1. **CNAME Record** (for subdomains):
   - Name: www or subdomain
   - Value: [Your WAF proxy domain]
   - TTL: 300 seconds (recommended)

2. **A Record** (for root domain):
   - Name: @ (root domain)
   - Value: [WAF Proxy IP]
   - TTL: 300 seconds (recommended)

## Security Features

The Nexole WAF provides several security features for domain protection:

- **WAF Rules**: Protect against common web attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- **Geo-Blocking**: Block traffic from specific countries
- **Threat Intelligence**: Use threat feeds to identify malicious IPs
- **ML Protection**: Use machine learning to detect anomalies and attacks
- **Bot Protection**: Identify and block malicious bots
- **SSL Verification**: Enforce secure SSL/TLS protocols

## Editing and Deleting Domains

To edit a domain:
1. Click the pencil icon next to the domain in the domain list
2. Make your changes in the edit form
3. Click "Save Changes"

To delete a domain:
1. Click the trash icon next to the domain in the domain list
2. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog

**Note:** Deleting a domain will remove all its protection settings and stop the WAF from filtering traffic. You will need to update your DNS records to route traffic directly to your origin server.
