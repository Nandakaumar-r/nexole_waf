# Nexole WAF - Domain Security Best Practices

This guide provides recommended configurations and best practices for securing your domains with Nexole WAF.

## Security Configuration Recommendations

### Essential WAF Rules

For all domains, we recommend enabling these core security rules:

| Rule Category | Why It's Important |
|---------------|-------------------|
| SQL Injection Protection | Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL queries |
| XSS Protection | Blocks cross-site scripting attacks that can steal user data |
| Command Injection | Prevents attackers from executing system commands |
| Path Traversal | Blocks attempts to access files outside the web root |
| Request Rate Limiting | Prevents brute force and DDoS attacks |

### Website Type-Specific Recommendations

#### E-commerce Websites

For online stores and payment processors:

- Enable strict **Bot Protection** to prevent price scraping and checkout fraud
- Enable **SSL Verification** with strict mode to ensure secure transactions
- Enable **Geo-Blocking** for countries where you don't do business
- Set **Rate Limiting** to prevent inventory hoarding and cart abuse
- Enable **ML Protection** with high sensitivity for transaction pages

#### Corporate Websites

For company information sites:

- Enable **Bot Protection** with medium strictness to allow legitimate bots
- Enable standard **WAF Rules** focusing on XSS and injection protections
- Set **Rate Limiting** at a moderate level
- Use **Geo-Blocking** selectively if you operate in specific regions only

#### API Endpoints

For application programming interfaces:

- Enable **WAF Rules** specifically designed for API protection
- Set strict **Rate Limiting** to prevent API abuse
- Enable **Threat Intelligence** to block known malicious IPs
- Consider disabling **Bot Protection** if your API serves legitimate bots

## DNS Configuration Best Practices

### TTL (Time To Live) Settings

- Set initial TTL values low (300-600 seconds) when first configuring the WAF
- Increase TTL values (1800-3600 seconds) after confirming everything works correctly
- Keep a backup of your original DNS settings before making changes

### HTTPS Configuration

- Always use HTTPS for all domains and subdomains
- Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers
- Configure proper redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- Use modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher)

## Multi-Domain Security Management

When protecting multiple domains:

### Security Consistency

- Create standard security templates for similar domain types
- Apply consistent rule sets across related domains
- Document exceptions when different security settings are needed

### Traffic Monitoring

- Regularly review traffic patterns across all domains
- Look for anomalies that might indicate an attack spreading across domains
- Set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns

## Performance Optimization

Balance security with performance:

### Rule Optimization

- Disable rules that don't apply to your specific application type
- Test rule changes in staging environments before applying to production
- Monitor performance impact after adding new security features

### Caching Strategy

- Configure appropriate caching headers
- Use CDN integration where appropriate
- Balance security checks with performance needs

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Update Schedule

- Review WAF rules monthly
- Update threat intelligence feeds weekly
- Analyze blocked traffic reports bi-weekly

### Security Posture Review

- Conduct quarterly security reviews of all domains
- Update security settings based on emerging threats
- Test security with periodic penetration testing

## Multi-Layer Security Approach

WAF should be one part of a comprehensive security strategy:

- **Edge Layer**: Nexole WAF, CDN
- **Network Layer**: Firewalls, VPNs
- **Application Layer**: Secure coding, input validation
- **Data Layer**: Encryption, access controls
- **User Layer**: Authentication, authorization

## Security Response Planning

### Incident Response

Have procedures ready for:

1. Identifying security incidents
2. Temporarily increasing security during active attacks
3. Post-incident analysis and WAF rule adjustments

### Emergency Contacts

Maintain an updated list of:

- Technical contacts for each domain
- Third-party security providers
- DNS provider emergency support contacts

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help ensure your domains are properly protected by Nexole WAF. Remember that security is an ongoing process that requires regular attention and updates as threats evolve.

**Remember**: The most secure configuration might not always be the most practical. Balance security needs with business requirements and user experience.
